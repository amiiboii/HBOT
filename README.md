# HBOT

To move the hbot, you need to modify the values of X, Y, F, and A in the cord.txt file. The X and Y axes can be moved independently using the following values:

  X: 1700 to -1300
  Y: 4300 to -4300

F represents the feed rate, while A represents the acceleration. It's important to use the given delays as they are more suitable for this purpose. To ensure the accuracy of the movements, it's advisable to make small increments and double-check the sequence before executing it.
